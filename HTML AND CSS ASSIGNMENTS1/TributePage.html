                    of 1948, with Indian and Pakistani soldiers facing each other
                    across the Line of Control, which has since divided Indian-held Kashmir from that part held by
                    Pakistan. Several UN
                    Security Council resolutions were passed, with Resolution 47 calling for a plebiscite to be held in
                    Kashmir to determine
                    accession to India or Pakistan, only after Pakistan withdrew its army from Kashmir.[36] A
                    precondition to the resolution
                    was for Pakistan and India to return to a state of "as was" before the conflict. Pakistan would
                    withdraw all tribesmen
                    and Pakistani nationals brought in to fight in Kashmir. Pakistan refused to pull back, and there
                    could be no further
                    dialogue on fulfilling the UN resolution.[37][36] Tensions between India and Pakistan, largely over
                    Kashmir, have never
                    been eliminated.</div>

                    state under the rule of the Nizam of Hyderabad, chose to
                    remain independent. The following stand-off between the Government of India and the Nizam ended on
                    12 September 1948,
                    when India's then Deputy Prime Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ordered Indian troops to secure
                    Hyderabad State. During
                    five days of fighting, the Indian Army, backed by an Indian Air Force squadron of Hawker Tempest
                    aircraft, routed the
                    Hyderabad State forces. Five Indian Army infantry battalions and one armoured squadron were engaged
                    in the operation.
                    The following day, Hyderabad was proclaimed part of India. Major General Joyanto Nath Chaudhuri, who
                    led the operation,
                    and accepted the surrender of the Nizam's forces on 18 September 1948, was appointed the military
                    governor of Hyderabad,
                    to restore law and order, and served until 1949.</div>

                    combat forces, India sent its 60th Parachute Field Ambulance
                    unit to aid the UN troops fighting against the North Korean invasion of South Korea, as part of the
                    1st Commonwealth
                    Division. In the aftermath of the war, an Indian infantry brigade formed the Custodian Force of
                    India, some of whose
                    soldiers were also part of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, which assisted in the
                    exchange of prisoners of
                    war and was headed by Lieutenant General K. S. Thimayya.[

                <div class="event-desc event-desc-nth-child">Even though the British and French vacated all their
                    colonial possessions in the Indian subcontinent, Portugal refused
                    to relinquish control of its colonies of Goa, Daman, and Diu. After repeated attempts by India to
                    negotiate were spurned
                    by Portuguese prime minister and dictator, António de Oliveira Salazar, on 12 December 1961 India
                    launched Operation
                    Vijay to capture the Portuguese colonies, which was accomplished by small contingents of Indian
                    troops. After a brief
                    conflict that lasted twenty-six hours—during which 31 Portuguese soldiers were killed, the
                    Portuguese Navy frigate NRP
                    Afonso de Albuquerque was destroyed, and over 3,000 Portuguese were captured—Portuguese General
                    Manuel António Vassalo e
                    Silva surrendered to Major General Kunhiraman Palat Kandoth of the Indian Army. Goa, Daman, and Diu
                    became a part of the
                    Republic of India.

                <div class="event-desc event-desc-nth-child">The cause of this war was a dispute over the sovereignty of
                    the widely separated Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh border
                    regions. Aksai Chin, claimed by India as part of Kashmir, and by China as part of Xinjiang, contains
                    an important road
                    link that connects the Chinese regions of Tibet and Xinjiang. China's construction of this road was
                    one of the triggers
                    of the conflict.

                    Small-scale clashes between Indian and Chinese forces broke out as India insisted on the disputed
                    McMahon Line being
                    regarded as the international border between the two countries. Chinese troops claimed not to have
                    retaliated to the
                    cross-border firing by Indian troops, despite sustaining losses.[38] China's suspicion of India's
                    involvement in Tibet
                    created more rifts between the two countries.[39]

                <div class="event-desc event-desc-nth-child">A second confrontation with Pakistan took place in 1965.
                    Although the war is described as inconclusive, India had the
                    better of the war and was the clear winner in tactical and strategic terms.[42][43][44] Pakistani
                    president Ayub Khan
                    launched Operation Gibraltar in August 1965, during which Pakistani paramilitary troops infiltrated
                    into
                    Indian-administered Kashmir and attempted to ignite anti-India agitation in Jammu and Kashmir.
                    Pakistani leaders
                    believed that India, which was still recovering from the Sino-Indian War, would be unable to deal
                    with a military thrust
                    and a Kashmiri rebellion. India reacted swiftly and launched a counter-offensive against Pakistan.
                    In reply, on 1
                    September Pakistan launched Operation Grand Slam, invading India's Chamb-Jaurian sector. In
                    retaliation, the Indian Army
                    launched a major offensive all along its border with Pakistan, with Lahore as its prime target.

                    members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who, on 1 October 1967, invaded Sikkim, which was
                    then a protectorate of
                    India. On 10 October, both sides clashed again. Defence minister Sardar Swaran Singh assured the
                    Indian people that the
                    government was taking care of developments along the border. Indian losses were 88 killed, and 163

                    rule in 1971, the Indian Army and the Indian police launched
                    Operation Steeplechase, a gigantic "counter-insurgency" operation against the Naxalites, which
                    resulted in the death of
                    hundreds of Naxalites and the imprisonment of more than 20,000 suspects and cadres, including senior
                    leaders.[55] The
                    army was also assisted by a brigade of para commandos and the Indian paramilitary. The operation was
                    organised in
                    October 1969, and Lieutenant General J.F.R. Jacob was enjoined by Govind Narain, the Home Secretary,
                    that "there should
                    be no publicity and no records". Jacob's request to be presented with written orders was also

                    against them, thousands of Bengalis took refuge in neighbouring India causing a major refugee crisis
                    there. In early
                    1971, India declared its full support for the Bengali freedom fighters, known as Mukti Bahini, and
                    Indian agents were
                    extensively involved in covert operations to aid them.[

                    the two sides in 1947. In consequence, before the 1980s neither India nor Pakistan maintained a
                    permanent military
                    presence in the region. However, beginning in the 1950s, Pakistan began sending mountaineering
                    expeditions to the
                    glacier. By the early 1980s, the Government of Pakistan was granting special expedition permits to
                    mountaineers and
                    United States Army maps showed Siachen as a part of Pakistan.[61] This practice gave rise to the

                    Pakistan lacked.
                    Diplomatic tensions eased after the Lahore Summit was held in 1999. However, the sense of optimism

                    and were to be reoccupied in spring. The troops that took control of these areas received important
                    support, of both
                    arms and supplies, from Pakistan. Some of the heights under their control, which also included the
